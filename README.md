### React application 

There are several React applications which to be constructed as projects in the course : Full Stack Open 2020 Helsinki University:https://fullstackopen.com/ as exercises. 

I finished the course last year, but now I have to remind the React for some other projects + there are a lot of new in 2020 in the course. 

The apps are:
