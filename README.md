### React application 

There are several React applications which to be constructed as projects in the course : Full Stack Open 2020 Helsinki University:https://fullstackopen.com/ as exercises. 

I finished the course last year, but now I have to remind the React for some other projects + there are a lot of new in 2020 in the course. 

The apps are: 
- courseinfo (list of courses + statistics)
- unicafe (positive/negative/neutral buttons + summary)
- anecdotes (list of anecdotes + possibiity for voting + choose most popular)
- phonebook (list of name/numbers + add name/number and filter by name)
- countries_info (get countries and weather data from public API)

Running on localhost:3000

The project is in progress
