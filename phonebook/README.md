# Phonebook React App


The app is configured to work with the server: 
https://github.com/Dmitri9149/Fullstack_React_Application

The production version may be produced by : 
```npm run build
```
and 'build' folder is to be copied to the build folder of the 
above mentioned server for front..backend integration. 

The server may be start by 'npm run dev' and will work on 
http://localhost:3001). Print 'npm start' from root of the app. The app is congigured as proxy:   
If the React code does an HTTP request to a server address at http://localhost:3000 not managed by the React application itself (i.e. when requests are not about fetching the CSS or JavaScript of the application), the request will be redirected to the server at http://localhost:3001. 

The fullstack application (this project + the abovementioned server) is running 
at https://lit-stream-57490.herokuapp.com/
